# Mineopoly

Mineopoly is simply Monopoly, but in Minecraft. It can support any version of the game (called "sets") and allows up to 8 players.

At the current time, sets must be created manually as a JSON file. There are plans to make a much more dynamic system of making them so that anyone can create one, however.

There will also be a repository of some base threads which can be found on my website.

### Currently existing sets:
- `London`

### Requirements
- Minecraft version 1.19.2 or later
- Java 17
- The Mineopoly map, which can be downloaded from my website

## Installation

The installation for Mineopoly is much the same as any other plugin. \
1. Download the plugin.
2. Add it to your server `plugins` directory.
3. Download the Mineopoly map.
4. Extract the zip and replace the existing `world` directory with it. If you do not have a world, rename the extracted folder to `world`.
5. Start your server.
